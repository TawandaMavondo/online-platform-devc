## Documentation

We use [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) for our documentation.

- ✔ It requires very little configuration
- ✔ Markdown is quick to write

### Requirements

In order to edit the documentation you will need:

- Python 3.5+
- Python Pip

Installation instructions for `mkdocs` are here: <https://www.mkdocs.org/#installation>

To install on debian run the following:

```bash
apt-get -y install --no-install-recommends gcc libpq-dev python3-dev python3-venv python3-wheel python3 python3-pip python3-setuptools
pip3 install wheels
pip3 install mkdocs mkdocs-material
```

To install on macos run the following:

```bash
brew install python
pip3 install mkdocs mkdocs-material
```

### Previewing

During development you can preview your changes to the documentation by running the `mkdocs` development server

```bash
mkdocs serve
```

Browse to <https://localhost:8000> to view the documentation while you are editing.

### Editing

- Documentation is in the form of markdown files, located in the `/docs` folder.
- The first page users view is `index.md`, all other pages are linked from there.
- New pages should be added directly to `/docs` as markdown files.
- Images should be added to the `img/` directory, and should have short, descriptive names. (e.g. `login_empty.png`).

Before you can build you **MUST**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TawandaMavondo/online-platform-devc.git
```

and

```bash
cd online-platform-devc
```

After that you can run yarn or npm install to intsall dependencies for the application

```bash
// When you use yarn as your default package manager
yarn

// when you use npm as your default package manager
npm install
```
